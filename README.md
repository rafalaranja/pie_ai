PieA
Introduction

PieA is an intelligent application designed to help the food industry reduce waste and improve production planning. In a sector increasingly affected by supply chain disruptions, rising production costs, regulatory pressures, and sustainability concerns, food waste remains a critical issue â€” with nearly 30% of global food production wasted annually.

Our solution focuses on tackling this challenge by bringing intelligence and adaptability into production planning.

Problem

Most factories still rely on master data and technical sheets to organize daily production planning. These sheets contain important information such as:
Production times
Required resources
Operation sequences
Equipment capacity
However, in many cases, this data is collected once and rarely updated, even when the factory reality evolves â€” changes in workforce, equipment, or working methods.
When technical sheets no longer reflect reality, planning becomes inefficient, leading to delays, waste, and hidden costs. Planned production often diverges from actual production, reducing competitiveness and making decision-making more difficult.

Our Solution: The Role of AI
PieA introduces an AI-powered system that continuously updates technical sheets based on the factoryâ€™s own historical data.
Instead of depending on outdated static information, the system analyzes production records over time and automatically readjusts key parameters.
This enables planning that is:
More efficient â€“ optimized resource allocation and reduced waste.
More accurate â€“ real planning that matches real execution.
More strategic â€“ data-driven insights that improve foresight and decision-making.
By combining automation, data analysis, and intelligent forecasting, PieA helps factories stay competitive in a changing environment.


Conclusion
PieA brings intelligence to production planning in the food industry. By reducing the gap between expected and actual results, it helps companies minimize waste, cut costs, and adapt to ever-changing conditions.
